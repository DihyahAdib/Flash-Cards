Im learning Korean and Arabic and thought it would be cool to create my own website that allows me to store, and see the definition of the vocab i learn from these languages.
its not finished but right now i just have the storing it locally for each person who uses this and ability to add words to the list, i might make it more intuitive later but this was just a small project i thought would be cool to do so no major updates.


Future updates 
> Cover Mode
  This mode will allow you to only show the "Foriegn language" so it will only show just the vocab and not its definition. this is not to be confused with Flash card mode

> Flash Card Mode
  This mode has a few qualities, firstly theres two modes to this mode, timer and casual. Timer mode will start a clock and randomize the words from your word bank esetially quizzing you from the words you've inputted, your allowed to select a certain words for this mode or just select all of the words in your bank if your up for the challenge! The word will appear on the screen and youll be prompted to give the correct definition, if its wrong it will flip and reveal the right answer
  casual mode has no timer and just allows you to quiz yourself on your own time but the feature for chosing which words to include in your test still stands.

These updates will come soon, i am working on a bajillion side projects. ðŸ˜…
