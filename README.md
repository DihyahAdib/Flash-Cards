Im learning Korean and Arabic and thought it would be cool to create my own website that allows me to store and see the definition of the vocabulary I learn from these languages.
It's not finished, but right now I just have the storage locally for each person who uses this and the ability to add words to the list. I might make it more intuitive later, but this was just a small project I thought would be cool to do, so no major updates yet.

Completed Features

Cover Mode completed
> Cover Mode:
> This mode will allow you to only show the "Foriegn language," so it will show just the vocabulary and not its definition. This is not to be confused with Flash card mode.

In progress

Casual Mode (WIP) 
> Casual mode has no timer and just allows you to quiz yourself on your own time, but the feature for choosing which words to include in your test still stands.

Timed Mode (WIP)
>This mode has a few qualities. First, there are two modes to this mode: timer and casual. Timer mode will start a clock and randomly randomize the words from your word bank, effectively quizzing you from the words you've inputted. You're allowed to select a certain word for this mode, or just select all of the words in your bank if you're up for the challenge! The word will appear on the screen, and you'll be prompted to give the correct definition; if it's wrong, it will flip and reveal the right answer.
Future updates


Memorization Mode: (WIP)
>These updates will come soon, i am working on a bajillion side projects. ðŸ˜…
